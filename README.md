# JS-Raycaster
A simple JavaScript raycaster I made in in 2018. There's not much to see except player movement and some moving walls.

Additionally, the other files contain useful custom libraries / utility functions I made. The code quality is not great though.

[[Live demo](https://tomlacko.github.io/JS-Raycaster)]


### Controls:
- WASD = movement
- Space = jump
- Shift = hold to run
- Mouse move = look left and right
- Escape = pause the game and unlock the mouse
- Numpad+/- = raises/lowers the gray door
- Mouse click = first click starts creating a wall at the player's position, second click confirms the second position and places the wall
